Extracting the data files
---------------------------

Due to license reasons it is not possible to package the data files.
Extracting the .hod files:

- Install homeworld 2 from the CD
- Apply patch to 1.1 (not sure this is needed)
- Extract background/ from homeworld2.big
  I used the `UnfBIG` tool for this
  You just need to extract the files, no deobfuscation of the lua files is needed
- Find .hod files that have associated _light.hod
